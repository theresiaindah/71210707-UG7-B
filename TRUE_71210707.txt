I won't talk
I won't breathe
I won't move 'til you finally see
That you belong with me
You might think I don't look
But deep inside in the corner of my mind
I'm attached to you
Hmm

I've waited all my life to cross this line
To the only thing that's true
So I will not hide
It's time to try anything to be with you
All my life I've waited
This is true
